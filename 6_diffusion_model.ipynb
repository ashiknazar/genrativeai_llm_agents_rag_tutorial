    "# 💨 Week 6: Diffusion Models – A New Frontier in Generative AI\n",

    "## 🌫️ What Are Diffusion Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion models are **likelihood-based generative models** that generate data by **reversing a gradual noising process**.  \n",
    "They have emerged as **state-of-the-art** in generating high-quality, diverse images and other complex data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Core Idea: Forward & Reverse Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📉 Forward Process (Diffusion)\n",
    "- Adds Gaussian noise to input data \\( x_0 \\) over a series of time steps.\n",
    "- Eventually transforms it into pure noise \\( x_T \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "> \\( q(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}) = \\mathcal{N}(x_t; \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \\beta_t I) \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 Reverse Process (Denoising)\n",
    "- Trains a model to learn how to remove noise step-by-step.\n",
    "- Starting from random noise, it gradually generates a clean sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \\( p_\\theta(x_{t-1} \\mid x_t) \\approx \\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t), \\Sigma_\\theta(x_t, t)) \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 How They Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train a neural network (usually a U-Net) to **predict the noise** added at each timestep.\n",
    "2. Sample new data by starting with noise and running the **reverse denoising process**.\n",
    "3. Use techniques like **classifier-free guidance** to control generation.\n",
