    "## 🧭 Why Ethics Matter in Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI models are powerful but come with **significant ethical implications**. As these systems become more integrated into society — from art to healthcare to education — it is essential to **evaluate their fairness, safety, transparency, and accountability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚨 Key Ethical Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Bias in Training Data**\n",
    "- Models reflect societal biases found in data (e.g., racial, gender, cultural).\n",
    "- Amplifies stereotypes or excludes underrepresented groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Hallucination & Misinformation**\n",
    "- LLMs can fabricate facts confidently.\n",
    "- Diffusion or GAN models may produce deceptive visual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Deepfakes & Disinformation**\n",
    "- Generative tools can create fake videos, voices, or documents.\n",
    "- Risks to political stability, reputation, and trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Intellectual Property (IP) Issues**\n",
    "- Models may mimic or plagiarize copyrighted material.\n",
    "- Raises legal questions about AI-generated content ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Privacy & Data Leakage**\n",
    "- Models trained on sensitive data may unintentionally leak it.\n",
    "- Example: Personal information being reconstructed from training corpus.\n",
