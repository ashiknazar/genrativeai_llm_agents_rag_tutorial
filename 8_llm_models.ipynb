    "\n",
    "**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are deep learning models trained on massive text corpora to understand and generate human-like text.  \n",
    "They are typically **transformer-based**, containing **hundreds of millions to trillions of parameters**.\n",

    "LLMs are capable of:\n",
    "- Text generation\n",
    "- Summarization\n",
    "- Translation\n",
    "- Code completion\n",
    "- Reasoning and question answering\n",
