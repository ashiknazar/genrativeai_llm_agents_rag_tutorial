    "An **AI Agent** is a system that can autonomously:\n",
    "- **Perceive** its environment\n",
    "- **Reason** and **plan** based on goals\n",
    "- **Act** to achieve objectives\n",
    "- **Learn** from interactions and feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of **LLMs and modern NLP**, an AI agent typically uses:\n",
    "- A **language model** for reasoning and generation\n",
    "- **Tools or APIs** (search, database, Python REPL, RAG, etc.) to take real-world actions\n",
    "- A **memory** system to retain and reference past interactions\n",
