    "## 🔄 Why Variants of GAN?\n",
    "\n",
    "While the original GAN architecture was a breakthrough, training instability and limited flexibility in output led to the development of several **variants** designed for:\n",
    "- Better convergence\n",
    "- Conditional generation\n",
    "- Style and domain translation\n",
    "- Higher-quality and diverse outputs\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🧬 Major GAN Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧱 1. **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)**\n",
    "- Introduced convolutional layers to GANs\n",
    "- Stable training on image datasets (e.g., MNIST, CelebA)\n",
    "- Generator uses transposed convolutions\n",
    "- Discriminator uses strided convolutions\n",
    "- **Applications**: Face generation, digit synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 2. **Conditional GAN (cGAN)**\n",
    "- Allows control over output by conditioning on labels \\( y \\)\n",
    "- Generator and Discriminator receive extra input \\( y \\)\n",
    "- **Applications**: Class-specific image generation (e.g., generate only cats or dogs)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Loss:  \n",
    "> \\( \\mathcal{L}_{cGAN} = \\log D(x|y) + \\log(1 - D(G(z|y))) \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 3. **CycleGAN**\n",
    "- Learns mappings between **two unpaired domains** (e.g., photos ↔ paintings)\n",
    "- Introduces cycle-consistency loss to ensure meaningful translation\n",
    "- No need for paired training data\n",
    "- **Applications**: Style transfer, photo enhancement, domain adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 4. **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)**\n",
    "- Uses **Earth-Mover (Wasserstein-1) distance** instead of cross-entropy\n",
    "- Provides smoother gradients and improves convergence\n",
    "- Requires Lipschitz continuity enforced by **weight clipping** or **gradient penalty (WGAN-GP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Loss:  \n",
    "> \\( \\mathcal{L}_{WGAN} = \\mathbb{E}[D(x)] - \\mathbb{E}[D(G(z))] \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💄 5. **StyleGAN / StyleGAN2**\n",
    "- Advanced architecture from NVIDIA for **high-resolution face generation**\n",
    "- Latent vector passed through a **style-based generator**\n",
    "- Supports **fine-grained control** over features (e.g., age, smile, gender)\n",
    "- **Applications**: Face synthesis, avatars, art, digital fashion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 6. **BigGAN**\n",
    "- Scalable GAN model for **high-quality and large-scale image generation**\n",
    "- Leverages class-conditional architecture and large batch sizes\n",
    "- **Applications**: ImageNet-level generation, commercial use cases\n",
