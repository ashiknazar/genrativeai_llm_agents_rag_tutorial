    "## ⚙️ What Are Transformers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers are **deep learning architectures** based on **self-attention mechanisms**, first introduced in the paper  \n",
    "> “Attention Is All You Need” (Vaswani et al., 2017).  \n",
    "\n",
    "They have revolutionized **sequence modeling** by enabling **parallel processing**, better **long-range dependency modeling**, and **scalability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Core Concepts Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Attention**: Allows the model to weigh the importance of each part of the input sequence dynamically.\n",
    "- **Positional Encoding**: Since Transformers lack recurrence, they use position encodings to capture sequence order.\n",
    "- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**:\n",
    "  - Encoder: Processes the input\n",
    "  - Decoder: Generates output sequence (used in tasks like translation, summarization)\n",

    "## 🪄 Why Transformers for Generation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers excel in generative tasks due to:\n",
    "- **Scalability to large data and models**\n",
    "- **Effective modeling of sequential and contextual information**\n",
